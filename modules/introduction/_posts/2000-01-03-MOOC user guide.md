## MOOC user guide

The course has been created using a template from P2P University, which strives to be user friendly and streamlined so that navigation is easy for all participants. It may take a bit of time to get used to, however, because every new online platform works a bit differently. This guide aims to help you navigate the different course features. If you are experiencing difficulty accessing any of the website, please let the [course creator](https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/about-us/) know.

[Home page](https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/): This page has links to the different parts of the course: the introduction to the course, the weekly course modules, the â€˜About usâ€™ page, and the discussion forum. You can also use the top bar to navigate to the introduction to the course and the weekly course modules.

[The course modules](https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/modules/the%20course%20modules/wk-1/): On the side bar on the left side of the screen, you will find a link to each of the 6 weeks. You can also access the next weekâ€™s materials by clicking on the arrow located at the bottom right part of the screen, which will direct you to the next sub-module. Each week has 5 sections: (1) an introduction to the week and what to expect, (2) a â€˜Focusâ€™ section, which offers video sessions regarding the weekâ€™s thematic focus, (3) a â€˜Readâ€™ section, which will have relevant readings and other resources for that weekâ€™s focus area, (4) a â€˜Doâ€™ section, which will have activities to help support your learning for the week, and (5) a â€˜Discussâ€™ section, which will instruct you what to contribute to the forum for that week.

[About us](https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/about-us/): This page offers more information about me as well as my contact details, should you have any questions, concerns, or technical difficulties.

[Discussion forum](https://www.edudialogue.org/forum/dialogue-mooc-on-dialogue/): This forum was built for you to discuss the weekly course materials, activities and for you to engage with one another about your experiences and challenges. There will be a different channel for each week. There will also be three other channels: (1) an introductions channel for you to post an introduction to yourself; (2) a â€˜news and course updatesâ€™ channel where any updates to the course will be posted. News and course updates will also be posted on the [home page](https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/) of the course website; and (3) a general channel for you to put any general comments or questions that might not fit within just one weekâ€™s channel.
