## Course etiquette

This course is a free and open course to anyone who is interested in participating. It is expected that all participants will treat one another with respect.

Online courses can be difficult to navigate socially at times, so the following guide is what is widely considered good etiquette to follow on the discussion forum:

* Firstly, participate! This is a shared learning environment and your contributions matter - for maximum benefit to all course participants, ensure that you’re using and posting in the forum.
* When you’re preparing your posts, review the requirements from the course page to ensure that your post is aligned with the expectation of the discussion topic and ensure that you're posting under the correct channel.
* Keep your posts and replies concise and to the point - reading other’s comments can take time and so ensure that there are no ‘extra’ bits in your posts.
* Check previous posts before posting yourself to avoid repetition.
* Cite your sources - if you’re referencing books, journal articles (or anyone’s intellectual property), ensure that you’re citing it.
* Use respectful language - criticism must be clear, constructive and well-meaning. Reading your post outloud before posting it might be a good way to check your tone. On this note, please don't use ALL CAPS - IT IS ALARMING TO READ and think about the way punctuation like exclamation marks can come across.
* Please report anything that isn’t working - this is a new forum and may have bugs.

Zoom etiquette: for the live components of the course, such as the welcome event and live coding webinar, we will use Zoom. When you sign into Zoom, ensure that you turn your microphone off until you want to speak. It's also good practice to keep your video on as much as you can, although I recognise that's not always possible. If you want to speak, there is a hand-raise function on Zoom.
