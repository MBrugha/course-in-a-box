If you are a self-paced participant, do not use the pre-course surveys above - please use [this registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1KvjTnqpQwO50MmuQVvDprVhPLfNH8zUYN77L7JPENfM/edit) to register for the course. If you are doing the course on your own time but would still like to receive a Certificate of Completion, you will need to post in the six weekly discussion forum channels (although you can miss one week) and provide a learning output, which will differ depending on which strand of the course you are taking. The detail of the learning outputs are described more fully during the weekly materials.
