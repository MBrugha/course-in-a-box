## Week four: Identifying key dialogic features in the classroom


Welcome to week four!


**_Facilitators and inquirers:_** This module will focus on analysing classroom talk through systematic observation and coding. We will discuss what we mean by coding, why we use coding, and how to code. This will include examples of coding using the available case studies in the T-SEDA pack as well as a coding exercise to practice. This module will also include considerations regarding research ethics for conducting classroom inquiries.
This module will also provide guidance to **_facilitators_** on leading colleagues through this process, including aiding in their selection of an appropriate analysis and coding method for their inquiries.
