## Week 5: Conducting an inquiry


Welcome to week five!


In this module, we will focus on conducting a reflective cycle for classroom inquiry.

**_Facilitators:_** This module will discuss your facilitation of reflective cycles of classroom inquiries with your colleagues, and effective mechanisms of support, collaboration, and sharing learning. 

**_Inquirers:_** You will be encouraged to finalise your focus area and begin your inquiry data collection if you have not done so already.

## Read

This week’s readings and resources are as follows:
* [T-SEDA week 5 materials](https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/img/TSEDA_resources_wk5.pdf): These include some of the same resources as in the week 3 T-SEDA materials, but would be helpful to revisit including examples of inquiries.
* Videos from [edudialogue.org](https://www.edudialogue.org/) site, which I’ve embedded below for convenience:

**Video 7:** This video on completing your reflective cycle gives more information about the reflective cycle and how to complete it.

**_Related resources:_**
* [T-SEDA additional resources](https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/img/TSEDA_additional_resources.pdf)
* Helpful publication on benefits of small group work: Howe, C., McWilliam, D., & Cross, G. (2005). Chance favours only the prepared mind: incubation and the delayed effects of peer collaboration. British Journal of Psychology, 96, 67-93.
* [Group work page](https://www.edudialogue.org/resources/promoting-dialogic-interactions-between-peers/) on edudialogue.org site, which includes requirements and activities for effective group work

**Video 16:** This video is about coding and rating the quality of small group dialogue. Note that we’ve already done the activity from this video together in the coding webinar below.

**Coding webinar:** 

This webinar is the same one as last week but placed in this week's materials in case you did not have a chance to access it yet. This webinar runs through a couple coding exercises for coding whole-class dialogue and rating small group dialogue. Download the resources prior to watching the webinar as you will need these to complete the activities.

**_Resources you will need to complete this webinar:_**
* [Video A for coding exercise 1](https://www.edudialogue.org/resources/introductory-video-series/introductory-video-series-3/): This is video 14 on the edudialogue.org site in case you cannot hear the video properly via the webinar video.
* [Video B for coding exercise 1](https://sms.cam.ac.uk/media/3099035)
* [Coding sheet for exercise 1](https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/img/coding_sheet_exercise1.doc)
* [Video for coding exercise 2](https://sms.cam.ac.uk/media/2856364)
* [T-SEDA tool 2C for exercise 2](https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/img/TSEDA_tool2C.doc)
* [T-SEDA tool 2D for exercise 2](https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/img/TSEDA_tool2D.doc)

## Do

There are different activities for facilitators and inquirers to complete this week:

**_Facilitators:_** As in prior weeks, please use the above materials to add to your facilitation plan and model. Consider the ways in which you will support your colleagues in those last three steps of the reflective cycle in particular, reviewing the following questions taken from the initial resource I drafted and included in the video slide:

* How will you support teachers in interpreting their data to answer their inquiry questions?
* How will you provide opportunities for teachers to share emerging outcomes and issues?
* How will you provide opportunities for individual and group reflection regarding the final results of the inquiries and the implications for their students and practice?
* How will you support teachers in identifying and making a plan to address areas for improvement that emerged from their inquiries?
* How will you puzzle out how to refine the inquiry process for the next time?
* How will you support teachers in identifying the key areas of learning (i.e. the successes and challenges) and ensure that these are captured as accessible resources for others to draw on?
* How will you support teachers in identifying what they can do next?

**_Inquirers:_** This week, continue with your inquiries. It’s ideal for you to have already started your data collection so that you can have some findings (even if they’re initial findings) to share by the end of the course next week. If you need to extend your inquiries beyond the end of next week, that’s absolutely fine! Everyone will have a different timeline for their inquiries, but do try to build on the momentum of the last few weeks and collect your data as soon as you can. I have extended the deadline to submit your inquiries in light of the busy time of year to April 10th 2021. If you haven’t started one already, start a reflective diary about the process and track strengths and weaknesses of your approach. You’ll appreciate the detail in the end! And finally, if possible, discuss your inquiry with your colleagues to get their opinions.

## Discuss

In the [week 5 discussion forum channel](https://www.edudialogue.org/forum/dialogue-mooc-on-dialogue/week-five-conducting-an-inquiry/), please post about the following:

**_Facilitators:_** This week, please post about your plans for supporting your colleagues throughout their inquiries and in particular what you think will be most difficult stages and how you can mitigate for these. You can also choose one or two questions from the list in the ‘Do’ section above to answer for this week’s post.

**_Inquirers:_** This week, please post about how your inquiries are progressing – if you’re experiencing any challenges or delays and any initial reflections regarding your data. Feel free to also pose a question to the group about something you are puzzling about and remember to respond to one another’s posts!
