## Week three: Self-audits and reflective inquiry

Welcome to week three!

This week will introduce the Teacher Scheme for Educational Dialogue Analysis (T-SEDA) pack in further detail, explore examples of self-audits of practice, and talk about conducting a reflective inquiry.

**_Facilitators:_** This module will review examples of self-audits of practice for you to lead your colleagues through and will also discuss the use of a reflective cycle for classroom inquiry and offer specific guidance regarding leading inquiries with a group (or groups) of practitioners.

**_Inquirers:_** The components of this module that are for the inquirer strand are to review examples of self-audits of practice as well as your answers on the survey you filled out at the beginning of this course and familiarise yourselves with the concept of reflective inquiry and the use of a reflective cycle for classroom inquiry. This will include numerous varied examples and activities to get you thinking about possible points of interests and goals of your own inquiry.

## Read

This week’s readings and resources are as follows:

* [T-SEDA pack components](https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/img/TSEDA_resources_wk3.pdf) for this week’s focus areas: This is a pdf of the relevant content from the most recent version of the T-SEDA pack (version 8) regarding an overview of the T-SEDA pack, more information on the self-audit, and content regarding the reflective cycle for classroom inquiry including guidance for refining your focus.
* [Self-audit template](https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/img/TSEDA_selfaudit.doc): Inquirers, you should have already filled out a self-audit that I circulated as a google form. It will be important to consider these results when you’re starting your reflective inquiry. If you are in the inquirer strand and have not completed the self-audit, please do so now either through [the google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScefMoRYzS14tsLl5ID6tRHMvfWW4V6Jrg8JDuRvVheTGcuXQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) or using this template instead. If you filled out a copy of the google form, but would like to also do this self-audit as well to look for further areas to focus on in your inquiries, please feel free to do so! 
* [T-SEDA coding scheme](https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/img/TSEDA_coding_scheme.png): This coding scheme will be helpful to revisit prior to filling out the reflective inquiry template in order to link your questions with the categories of dialogue.
* [Reflective inquiry template](https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/img/TSEDA_reflective_cycle.doc): This template has three parts to help you record your inquiry details – part A has the blank reflective cycle, part B offers a planning and reflection template to help you plan your inquiry, and part C offers a case study template for you to record your inquiries to mobilise your learning afterwards. Facilitators, having a tailored case study template for your setting can be a good way of mobilising effective practice and progress within different departments or groups of teachers.
* [Video 6](https://www.edudialogue.org/resources/introductory-video-series/collection-2/#video6) on the edudialogue.org site: This video describes conducting the self-audit in further detail. Facilitators: this video will be helpful to share with your colleagues.
* [Video 9](https://www.edudialogue.org/resources/introductory-video-series/collection-2/#video9) on the edudialogue.org site: This video describes the positive impact that T-SEDA inquiry has had. There are examples of teachers’ reflections on their T-SEDA inquiry from around the world, and more advice about how to carry out your own inquiry.
* Audio recording from facilitator interview: This recording is the first of a series of interviews with facilitators where they share successes, challenges and tips for those considering facilitation.

## Do

There are different activities for facilitators and inquirers to complete this week:

**_Facilitators:_** This week, continue to add to your facilitation plan and continue to gather the resources that you will use to introduce teachers in your setting to the use of a reflective cycle for classroom inquiry. Questions to answer for your plan may include:
1. How would you adapt the resources from the T-SEDA pack to your setting? 
2. How can you ensure that teachers don’t lose momentum when conducting a reflective inquiry into their practice? 
3. What support can you provide when teachers are formulating their inquiry foci and questions? (E.g. to ensure that their questions are realistic and not overly ambitious or unfocused). 

In the audio resource I’ve included in the resource section above, one of the tips that Sarah shared was to hold a brainstorming session as a group because she observed that formulating good inquiry questions was harder than she had thought it would be. Using a jamboard could be a good way of conducting one of these sessions online. Also take a look at the T-SEDA pack contents for this week listed in the resources section on choosing an inquiry focus for further helpful guidance to adapt and share with the teachers in your setting.

**_Inquirers:_** Using the resources linked in the section above, think about and write down your goals and interests for your inquiries following the guidance in the T-SEDA pages. Your inquiry focus and questions should be refined and not too ambitious! Once this is done, try to fill out the next two sections of this template, even if you need to refine it further next week. So within the reflective cycle, you should have completed box one on interest and aims, box two on focus and inquiry questions, and box three on your inquiry plan and methods.

## Discuss

In the [week three discussion forum channel](https://www.edudialogue.org/forum/mooc-self-paced/week-three-self-audits-and-reflective-inquiry-2/), please post about the following:

**_Facilitators,_** you can use this channel to post about your reflections from the week’s activities – this may include posting your answer to one or two of the activity’s questions: (1) How would you adapt the resources from the T-SEDA pack to your setting? (2) How can you ensure that teachers don’t lose momentum when conducting a reflective inquiry into their practice? (3) What support can you provide when teachers are formulating their inquiry foci and questions?

**_Inquirers,_** you can use this channel to post a summary of the area(s) you wish to explore in your inquiry. Think about the challenges you may encounter and the ways in which you will mitigate these.
