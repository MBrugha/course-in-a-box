## Week four: Identifying key dialogic features in your setting


Welcome to week four!

This module will focus on analysing classroom talk through systematic observation and coding. We will discuss what we mean by coding, why we use coding, and how to code. This will include examples of coding using the available case studies in the T-SEDA pack as well as a coding exercise to practice. This module will also include considerations regarding research ethics for conducting classroom inquiries.

**Facilitators**, this module will provide an additional focus on leading colleagues through this process, including aiding in their selection of an appropriate analysis and coding method for their inquiries.

**Inquirers**, it would be helpful to come into this week with a firmer understanding of what you want to look at in your individual inquiries.

## Read

This week’s readings and resources are as follows:
* [BERA ethical guidelines](https://www.bera.ac.uk/publication/ethical-guidelines-for-educational-research-2018?utm_source=BERA+Master+List&utm_campaign=837fd94784-+&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_66cbc2c388-837fd94784-274600501)
* [T-SEDA week 4 materials](https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/img/TSEDA_resources_wk4.docx): these include more information regarding research ethics and ensuring your inquiries are conducted ethically, there is more information about coding and rating as well as planning your inquiry and collecting baseline data. Lastly, there are numerous supporting resources which offer many templates for you to use and adapt where needed.
* Videos from [edudialogue.org](edudialogue.org) site: [Video 10](https://www.edudialogue.org/resources/introductory-video-series/collection-3/#video10) and [Video 11](https://www.edudialogue.org/resources/introductory-video-series/collection-3/#video11) on using the coding scheme: Video 10 introduces the categories of dialogue that we discussed in Week two of the course, but it may be helpful to revisit. Video 11 reviews the remainder of the codes that I didn’t walk through in Week 2, so this is worth watching.

## Do

There are different activities for facilitators and inquirers to complete this week:

**_Facilitators:_** As in prior weeks, please use the above materials to add to your facilitation plan and model. Consider the ways in which you will support your colleagues in familiarising themselves with the coding scheme and available templates. Are there some that will work better in your setting than others? Are there any that require adaptation to be more relevant for your setting? Or if you’re in fact looking to enhance the dialogue between your colleagues and wish to code it, please include which categories you plan to focus on as well as how you will code these. Please also review the ethical questions below and incorporate this into your plan.

**_Inquirers:_** This week, you should: (1) Finalise your inquiry focus and decide a timeline. (2) Choose the codes or rating scales you want to use based on your inquiry question(s). (3) Decide what type of systematic observation is most helpful for your specific inquiry focus (e.g. coding lessons live, from video or audio recordings, or transcripts of those records).

**_Additional activities to do are as follows:_**
* Think about the ethics in your setting, and consider the following questions regarding research ethics in conducting your inquiries. Facilitators, consider ways in which you can ensure your colleagues are supported in conducting ethical inquiries (e.g. an initial ethics workshop and then having ethics as part of weekly check-ins):
  * Should the views of others (parents, students) be considered?
  * What are the benefits of your inquiry? (e.g. to colleagues, students)
  * How will you protect your participants’ data? (e.g. written or recorded)
  * How will you explain the inquiry to your students and others in the school?
  * When sharing findings, how can you ensure anonymity and confidentiality?
  * Might any negative or embarrassing data emerge from the inquiry?
  * How will you protect your students from harm from any negative data?
  * Do you need signed consent forms from students or their parents? You are unlikely to need them for usual classroom learning activities, but you may need them for recording or filming.
  * How will you protect the privacy of others involved in the inquiry?
  * Do you need to give credit to colleagues for any of your data?
* Complete the activities as listed in Video 3 of the ‘Focus’ section above. For this you’ll need the following (also linked underneath the video above):
  * [Video: Shackleton’s Difficult Decision](https://sms.cam.ac.uk/media/2856333): Watch this video and try to code the transcript below.
  * [Shackleton's Difficult Decision](https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/img/Shackleton_coding_activity.doc): This is a transcript for the coding activity for you to complete, which includes tool 2A from the T-SEDA pack.
  * [Coding cheat sheet](https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/img/Coded_Shackleton_transcript.pdf): Use this to check your coding with the filled in transcript.
* Watch [Video 17](https://www.edudialogue.org/resources/introductory-video-series/collection-4/) from the edudialogue site, which I’ve also embedded below. This video is on how to rate student participation in dialogue.

* Resources referenced in the video:
  * [T-SEDA pack tool 2C](https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/img/TSEDA_tool2C.doc): This is a checklist for individual students that can be used at the end of a groupwork activity.
  * [Science lesson](https://sms.cam.ac.uk/media/2827690): This is to observe the clip and think about how to rate the segment as is assigned in the video (0,1, or 2).
  * [T-SEDA editable templates](https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/img/TSEDA_editable_templates.doc): Please note that these are from the previous version of the pack – version 7 – but may offer helpful additional templates to use and adapt where needed.

Don’t forget to watch the coding webinar above, which reviews two exercises for coding and rating dialogue - one during a whole-class lesson and one for small group work.

## Discuss

In the [week 4 discussion forum channel](https://www.edudialogue.org/forum/mooc-self-paced/week-four-identifying-key-dialogic-features-in-your-setting-2/#post-190), please post about the following:

**_Facilitators,_** you can use this channel to post about and discuss this week’s focus area and your plans for incorporating relevant materials and templates into your facilitation plan. Do you anticipate any challenges? How will you mitigate for these? (E.g. teachers may prefer to live code because this takes less time, but they may lose track of turns within the dialogue and may miss key dialogic features – you could host a F2F or online workshop to specifically discuss methods of recording dialogue in their classes as well as the ethical considerations that go along with this)

**_Inquirers,_** you can use this channel to post about your experiences doing the coding activities in the ‘Do’ section of the module – what was challenging about these exercises? How do you think you will code dialogue in your own inquiry (live, audio or video)? Which codes will you focus on in your inquiry?

Remember to respond to others’ posts and to reach out to me or your course peers with any questions or queries!
