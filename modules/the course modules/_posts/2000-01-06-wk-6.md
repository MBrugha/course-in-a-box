## Week 6: Continuing the role of facilitator and your inquiries


Welcome to week six, the final week of this self-paced course!

This week will look at the headway that has been made and invite you to share the outcomes or the progress of your learning. 

**_Facilitators:_** This module will discuss how you will continue your role as facilitator in your setting. This will involve a discussion of organisational structures, plans of how to sustain impact in your setting, and short- and medium-term facilitation plans.

**_Inquirers:_** You will be encouraged to continue with your inquiries this week and discuss your progress with other participants. It’s normal for everyone to be at different stages in this process – this week’s module includes many links to additional resources to support you and don’t forget to reach out to one another. Similarly, if your inquiry takes you past the end of the MOOC, that is perfectly reasonable. Everyone will have different lengths - if it’s 2 weeks or 8 weeks, that is completely up to you and what you’ve decided to focus on. And because this is self-paced instead of one of the 6-week live trials, you can also choose to extend the length of your participation to better fit your inquiry or facilitation.

For both facilitators and inquirers, please remember that you don’t need to have a perfect facilitation model or completed reflective inquiry – indeed, there is no perfect standard one of either of these. They’ll look completely different from person to person and so stay focused on what would be helpful for you and your setting.

## Focus of the week

Watch the following video for an overview of the week's focus **(please note that this and the other weekly videos were developed for the first live trial - there may therefore be references to live events or other activities which are irrelevant for the self-paced version)**.

## Read

This week’s readings and resources are as follows:

**_Facilitators_**: [Visual reference guides for facilitators](https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/img/Facilitator_resources.doc.zip), which include a guide for planning your facilitation, conducting a needs assessment and designing your facilitation model, as well as a step-by-step guide for supporting your colleagues during their reflective inquiries.

**_Inquirers_**: The following are examples of Inquirer learning outputs. These resources are from students in a recent Practitioner Professional Development course and indicate the types of reflective inquiries that can be conducted as well as the way to capture and present the learning from the inquiries. I have put a range of examples for you to choose from to review based on which ones are most relevant for your context. It is not expected that your inquiry learning outputs will be as detailed or long as the inquiry reports, but they may be helpful to review for inspiration. More of these reports, resources as well as videos of the students explaining the results of their inquiries are available on [edudialogue.org](https://www.edudialogue.org/resources/inquiry-resources/) so please take a look!

**_Facilitators and Inquirers_**:

Because this is the last module, I have also included some additional sites for you to find more information and resources, however this list is not exhaustive so make sure that you do your own searching as well!

* [Edudialogue.org](http://www.edudialogue.org): This website is a community hub built for practitioners and researchers interested in sharing insights, resources and support regarding the use of educational dialogue in their settings. Take a look through the site for more information about educational dialogue and helpful tools and resources for enhancing the use of dialogue in your educational setting.
* [DIALLS](http://dialls2020.eu/): DIALLS is a project that supports the development of dialogue and argumentation in young people across nine countries. This includes an excellent [library](https://dialls2020.eu/library-en/) of numerous tools and resources.

## Do

The activities for this week will be finalising your learning products. If you are taking the self-paced version of this course and post your learning output in the Week 6 discussion forum channel, please also email me (meb78@cam.ac.uk) to ensure that I've seen it so you can receive a Certificate of Completion for the course.

**_Facilitators:_** As you’re refining your facilitation model and plan, use the resources included in the ‘Read’ section above to help fill in any gaps, however please do remember that this will likely be a living resource so do not worry if it doesn’t look final! It may also be helpful to split your plan into short-term and medium-term.

As mentioned in last week’s video, your learning output will be a summary of your facilitation model / plan in any shape of your choosing (e.g. a diagram, a narrative overview, an audio recording of your explanation of your model). You can also provide a completed version of Facilitator Resource 1 or 2 from the resources included in this week’s ‘Read’ section. My priority is for your learning output to be useful to you so please choose whatever mode is most conducive to your continued use of it.

Your model should answer or seek to tentatively answer some of the following questions among others, where relevant:

* How will you support teachers in identifying their interests and aims?
* How will you help teachers to narrow their focus and inquiry questions?
* How will you support teachers in designing their inquiry plan and methods?
* How will you consider the results together and ensure there is space for reflection?
* How will you support teachers in making an action plan for what to do following the completion of their inquiries?
* How will you review the inquiry process with teachers regarding capturing successes and challenges?

**_Inquirers:_** Your learning output should offer a summary of either the results of your reflective inquiry or its progress if it is still being undertaken. This should include the filled in version of the [reflective cycle editable template](https://mbrugha.github.io/course-in-a-box/img/TSEDA_reflective_cycle.doc) as well as your answers to the following questions:

* Please describe your classroom / educational context.
* What were your research questions that guided your inquiry? Which categories of dialogue did you focus on?
* How did you collect your data? Did this work well?
* What were the most challenging aspects of your inquiry?
* What results did you achieve? Were these expected or did you find anything surprising?
* Have you changed anything or make a plan to change anything because of the results of your inquiry?
* What would you do differently next time?
* What advice would you give to someone else who is carrying out an inquiry?
* What will you focus on next?

Your learning output can be submitted through uploading it on the [Week 6 discussion forum channel](https://www.edudialogue.org/forum/dialogue-mooc-on-dialogue/week-6-continuing-the-role-of-facilitator-and-your-inquiries/) or by emailing it to me directly: meb78@cam.ac.uk.

Please fill out the [post-course survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2H32Va8aMIWmqaCXDmy9lXn4pDrEzLNj7nQLz52WZPgNn_A/viewform?usp=sf_link) about your experience in the course – your insights will be extremely helpful to me for my research and desire to create meaningful materials that are genuinely helpful for practitioners! You don’t have to have completed all course materials to fill in the survey.

## Discuss
In the [Week 6 discussion forum channel](https://www.edudialogue.org/forum/mooc-self-paced/week-six-continuing-the-role-of-facilitator-and-your-inquiries/#post-209), please post a brief description of either your facilitation model (for facilitators) or your inquiry focus and summary of your findings (for inquirers) and upload your learning output to the post, if you would like to receive a Certificate of Completion (you can also email the file to me directly if you have difficulty uploading it or wish for it to not be seen by your peers). And you can also use this channel to discuss anything particularly surprising or challenging about the process of either developing your facilitation model or conducting your reflective inquiry.
