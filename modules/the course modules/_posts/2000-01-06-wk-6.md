## Week 6: Continuing the role of facilitator and your inquiries


Welcome to week six, our final week together in this trial!

This week will look at the headway that has been made, answer any of your questions and address concerns, and invite you to share the outcomes or the progress of your learning. 

**_Facilitators:_** This module will discuss how you will continue your role as facilitator in your setting. This will involve a discussion of organisational structures, plans of how to sustain impact in your setting, and short- and medium-term facilitation plans.

**_Inquirers:_** You will be encouraged to continue with your inquiries this week and discuss your progress with other participants. It’s normal for everyone to be at different stages in this process – this week’s module include many links to additional resources to support you and don’t forget to reach out to one another. Similarly, if your inquiry takes you past the end of the MOOC, that is perfectly reasonable. Everyone will have different lengths - if it’s 2 weeks or 8 weeks, that is completely up to you and what you’ve decided to focus on.
