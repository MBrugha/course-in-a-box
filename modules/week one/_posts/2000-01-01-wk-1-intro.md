# Week one: The role of the facilitator


### Welcome to week one!


If you haven't already watched it, here is a short video, which introduces the course structure and materials and reviews what to expect over the next 6 weeks. As is discussed in the course introductory video, there are two participant strands in this course: one for facilitators (individuals who will already hvae some familiarity with educational dialogue and wish to take their knowledge a step further to support their colleagues in developing their dialogic practices as well) and one for inquirers (individuals who want to learn more about educational dialogue and conduct their own reflective inquiry into their practice but are not interested in guiding their colleagues through the same process at this point in time). Each week will offer targeted objectives, resources and activities depending on which strnad of the course you are taking so follow the sign-posting throughout the course to ensure that you are accessing the correct content.


**_Facilitators:_** In this first module, we will discuss what it means to be a facilitator, drawing on learning from a recent trial using T-SEDA [https://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/research/programmes/tseda/]. This will include the role of the facilitator, possible facilitation models, and issues and potential constraints faced by facilitators.

**_Inquirers:_** There is nothing for you to review on the MOOC this week, however please complete the self-audit of your practice and consent form for the use of your data [https://forms.gle/yHmZD6UaA4wkwzJF7]. You will need to do the self-audit prior to engaging in any course materials. Please also post an introduction in the discussion forum with: (1) an introduction (what grade / subject you teach; where you're located; etc.), and (2) what you want to get out of this course.
