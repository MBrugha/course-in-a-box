## Week one: What is educational dialogue?

Welcome to week one!

If you haven't already watched it, here is a short video, which introduces the course structure and materials and reviews what to expect over the next 6 weeks.

In this first module, we will discuss what we mean by educational dialogue and review categories of dialogue. The module will also provide basic theories behind educational dialogue and a summary of related research findings and evidence that dialogue promotes student learning. We will also define the role of the facilitator in more detail and talk about how this might apply to your setting.

Have you completed your self-audit of your practice yet? You will need to do this prior to beginning the course.
