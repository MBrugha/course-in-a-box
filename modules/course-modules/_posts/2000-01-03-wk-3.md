## Week three: Self-audits and reflective inquiry

Welcome to week three!

This weekâ€™s module will focus on analysing classroom talk through systematic observation and coding. We will discuss what we mean by coding, why we use coding, and how to code. This will include examples of coding using the available case studies in the T-SEDA pack as well as a coding exercise to practice, while trading with peers. This module will also include considerations regarding research ethics for conducting classroom inquiries.

This module will also discuss reflective inquiry, the use of a reflective cycle for classroom inquiry and offer specific guidance regarding leading inquiries with a group of practitioners.

**_Inquirers:_** The components of this module that are for the inquirer strand are to review examples of self-audits of practice and familiarise yourselves with the concept of reflective inquiry and the use of a reflective cycle for classroom inquiry.
