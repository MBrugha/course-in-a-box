## Week one - What is educational dialogue?

Welcome to week one!

If you haven't already watched it, here is a short video, which introduces the course structure and materials and reviews what to expect over the next 6 weeks.

In this first module, we will discuss what we mean by educational dialogue and review categories of dialogue. The module will also provide basic theories behind educational dialogue and a summary of related research findings and evidence that dialogue promotes student learning. We will also define the role of the facilitator in more detail and talk about hwo this might apply to your setting.

If you are planning to do your own inquiry during this course, or will be leading your colleagues through conducting an inquiry, don't forget to complete your self-audit prior to beginning the course.
